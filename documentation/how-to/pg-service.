# The pg_service.conf file

A pg_service.conf file allows to use an alias name for a postgres server.
Instead of storing hostname, port, database name and more into
the QGIS Project file, these can be stored separately.
It is even possible to store username and password
in a pg_service.conf file, to avoid having this
stored in clear text in the QGIS Project.

If you directly connect from QGIS to your database
you can make use of a pg_service.conf file by placing it
in the app data folder.
